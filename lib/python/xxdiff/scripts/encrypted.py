"""xx-encrypted [<options>] <encrypted-file> [<encrypted file> ...]

Compare and merge contents of encrypted files relatively safely.

This script wraps around xxdiff, first decrypting the input files to temporary
files (for a short time) and running xxdiff on these files.  There are two
typical uses of this program:

1) it is used to compare two encrypted files.  With the --output option, a
   decision is required and an encrypted version of the merged file is output to
   the specified file and the merged file deleted promptly.  Note that without
   the --output option, even if the merged file is saved, it is deleted once
   xxdiff exits.

2) it is used to split and resolve CVS conflicts in an armored encrypted file
   (see --unmerge option).  The merged file is encrypted and output over the
   conflictual input file (i.e. it replaces it with the encrypted version of the
   merged file).  This is very useful if you maintain armored encrypted files in
   CVS repositories because otherwise an encrypted file with a CVS conflict in
   it becomes useless.

Using gpg-agent
---------------

Usage of this program with password caching using gpg-agent makes it much easier
to call on multiple files.  The user's password given key is asked only once by
gpg-agent, kept in memory, and then decryption occurs without user intervention.

Merging Encrypted Files with Mercurial
--------------------------------------

Mercurial can be easily configured so that this tool gets invoked automatically
when encrypted files need to be merged. This way you can independently
edit encrypted files using Emacs (I use a custom mailcrypt setup to seamlessly
decode on open and encode on save) and when tracked in a Mercurial repository,
if the encrypted files have been edited in two separate revisions, xx-encrypted
is invoked automatically and brings up a 3-way xxdiff to merge them interactively.
Here's the configuration I use in my .hgrc::

  [merge-tools]
  xx-encrypted =
  xx-encrypted.priority = 100
  xx-encrypted.premerge = False
  xx-encrypted.args = $local $base $other -o $output

  [merge-patterns]
  **.asc = xx-encrypted
  **.gpg = xx-encrypted

Safety Notes
------------

The encrypted files are decrypted to temporary files for a short amount of time,
and are deleted when xxdiff appears.  Note that their deletion is as safe as
Python's tempfile module allows it to be (in the author's opinion, safe
enough). I left comments in the code to allow a user to review where the files
are decrypted so they can judge by themselves if it is safe enough for their
use.

We could do much better in terms of safety if we could feed the input files to
xxdiff through different file descriptors (not impossible to implement) AND
calculate the diffs internally.

(Note that if someone can manipulate which program is used to actually perform
the diffs (e.g. modifying an unsuspecting user's resources in ~/.xxdiffrc), they
could feed the decrypted files to an arbitrary program.)
