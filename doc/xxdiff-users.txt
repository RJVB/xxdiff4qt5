  “Many of us here at NASA Langley Research Center use your tool for
  graphical diffs during software development.  We also use
  xxdiff-subversion integration into subversion.  I personally can no
  longer read context diff output as I have gotten so used to xxdiff (well
  at least that's what I tell people when I refuse to work without xxdiff).”

  Thanks for the great work!
