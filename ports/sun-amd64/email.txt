Greetings Martin,
 
I modified the Makefile adding an explicit rule for .y files. This is the only significant modification I did for it to work. Somehow - maybe it is a bug in make - make uses an implicit rule to produce .o from .y and therefore, because there is no such rule in the generated Makefile, I added a new one and guessed how this file should be built. You can see the changes in the Makefile attached.

I want to note also that I compiled the project in 32bit. The g++, gcc I got doesn't support 64 yet. I need to build it again, and I need to build QT again to support 64bit. I intend to do that slowly because I don't have much time for it.

I also compiled the project on my SUSE 10.1 machine on PC (Pentium D) without any modifications.

Please tell me if you need anything else.

thanks,
Hanna
