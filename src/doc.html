<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</a></h1>
<p>xxdiff is a <em>graphical file and directories comparison and merge
tool</em>. This program is an essential software development tool that can be
used to</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>visualize the differences between files or directories;</li>
<li>merge files with differences, resolving conflicts and saving output to a
new file or patch;</li>
<li>assist file changes reviewing and comment production (e.g. approving source
code changes before they get merged into a source tree).</li>
</ul>
<p>xxdiff doesn't itself compute the differences between files, it just displays
them graphically (the rationale behind this is that you can use different tools
to compute the actual diffs (for example using Rational ClearCase's cleardiff,
which gives more sensible results than GNU diff in certain cases),
there is a relatively standard format for difference output (POSIX diff),
so it is easy and efficient to parse diff output from different programs,
under the UNIX dataflow paradigm, it is common for graphical tools to be
built on top of text tools. There are already many good tools to perform diffs,
so there's no need to rewrite them.</p>

<div class="section" id="version">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Version</a></h1>
<p>This documentation was generated for version:</p>
<div id="version">
  <version/>
</div></div>
<div class="section" id="invocation">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invocation</a></h1>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
xxdiff [OPTIONS] &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; [&lt;file3&gt;]
</pre>
<p>You can specify either two files (two-way diff), three files (three-way diff),
or two directories (directory diff).</p>
<p>You can also specify a mix of regular files and directories.  If at least one of
the paths specified on the cmdline is a regular file, all other paths that are
directories will have the basename of the regular filename appended to them.
For example, if you specify:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
xxdiff dir1/bn1 dir2/bn2 dir3
</pre>
<p>xxdiff will be run on <tt class="docutils literal">dir1/bn1</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">dir2/bn2</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">dir3/bn1</tt>.</p>
<p>xxdiff can accept one of its inputs from stdin. You must replace the relevant
filename by '<tt class="docutils literal">-</tt>' (a dash) to instruct xxdiff to use stdin for that file,
e.g.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cat file2 | sort | xxdiff file1 - file3
</pre>
<p>If all the file paths are directories, a directory diff is invoked.  Note that
xxdiff doesn't do three-way directory diffs.</p>
<p>If the &quot;unmerge&quot; option is given, then xxdiff can only be invoked with a single
file containing the conflicts.</p>
<div class="section" id="return-value">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return Value</a></h2>
<p>xxdiff returns the same values that diff(1) or diff3(1) return. See the
respective man pages of those utilities for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="command-line-options">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command-line Options</a></h2>
<div id="invocation">
<invocation/>
</div><p>Note that the last few options are provided compatible with common GNU diff
options that the user might want to use, as a mere convenience.  Note also that
xxdiff options are a superset of the original xdiff options, so that xxdiff is
compatible with old SGI scripts that use xdiff.  xxdiff options follow the GNU
conventions for command-line options.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-xxdiff-as-a-short-lived-application">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using xxdiff as a short-lived application</a></h2>
<p>xxdiff has not been designed with the intent of being used over multiple sets of
files over the course of one execution---that is, it has been built around the
idea that you would execute it once over a single set of inputs, use it, then
exit, rather than to open new files again using the 'file' menu features without
exiting.  The 'file' menu features are provided as a convenience, to allow one
to occasionally replace one of the files during an execution.  That is the
reason why you can't open xxdiff with just one file.  It is just not useful that
way.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="general-operation">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General operation</a></h1>
<p>This section describes general features and operation of xxdiff.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-text-area">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text area</a></h2>
<p>xxdiff shows up with two or three text regions that display the text of the
files to compare, with color-coded blocks that indicate regions of text (lines)
that have changes (specific sections contain a list and descriptions on what
types of change can appear).  Each of these regions of text is called a &quot;hunk&quot;
in diff terminology (for more about this, see the GNU diff manual).  The text
area can be scrolled vertically and horizontally, when necessary.</p>
<p>Corresponding regions of text are aligned between the files.  Since changed
regions do not necessarily contains the same number of lines, empty alignment
lines are appended to the shorter regions in order to keep the corresponding
lines aligned (this is a simple way of solving the alignment problem; an
alternate solution would have been to implement a smart type of scrolling with
lines indicating correspondance of regions between them).</p>
<p>All the colors can be individually configured using the display options dialog
or resources.  The display dialog contains a legend of all the colors.  Note
that the default colors for different regions are often set to be the same to
other types of lines when it is not necessary to dissociate them, to avoid
visual clutter.  You could however, customize every region to be of a different
color, for example, perhaps you would want to have the dummy lines drawn of a
special color to indicate that they are not really part of the text.</p>
<p>In the text area, there is a cursor that in indicates the current line of text
being worked on.  This cursor can be optionally hidden.</p>
<div class="section" id="horizontal-diffs">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">4.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horizontal diffs</a></h3>
<p>Each of the diff hunks is normally displayed in one color, but if horizontal
diffs is enabled, for each line, xxdiff find the smallest differing part of the
line that differs and displays that in a different, highlighted color.  This
allows the user to more quickly visualize exactly what has changed between the
two lines of text.  No need to mention, this is highly addictive and is now
enabled by default.  This is the &quot;single horizontal diffs&quot; mode.</p>
<p>When there are no more than two pieces of text on a single line, if the
differing parts of the lines are not too long (e.g. less than 100 chars), the
horizontal diffs can isolate the differences within the line.  This is the
&quot;multiple horizontal diffs&quot; mode.  In this mode, we require that between
horizontal changes, inserts or deletes, there be a minimal number of common
context characters, so that the eye can make out what has change between the
lines.  This value is configurable (see resources section).</p>
<p>When computing horizontal diffs, <strong>changes</strong> in whitespace can be optionally
ignored.  However, if whitespace has been added in the middle of a word, it will
still be highlighted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="per-hunk-ignore-whitespace">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">4.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Per-hunk ignore whitespace</a></h3>
<p>Diff Hunks with text on all sides but with just whitespace or line break
differences will be detected by xxdiff and marked with a special flag. If the
feature is enabled, those hunks will be drawn of a different color, thus
enabling the reviewer to quickly ignore those hunks. See the merge review
features section for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="navigation">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">4.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigation</a></h3>
<p>xxdiff supports a subset of the emacs bindings, as well as support for most of
the standard keys found on AT keyboards (PgUp, PgDown, arrow keys, Home, End).</p>
<p>Default bindings include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ctrl-V, Alt-V: scroll up/down;</li>
<li>Ctrl-N, Ctrl-P: move cursor one line up/down;</li>
<li>Home, End: move cursor to beginning/end of files;</li>
<li>N, P: move to next/previous diff hunk;</li>
<li>B, O: mov the next/previous <strong>unselected</strong> diff hunk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explore the menus to find out about the other default bindings.  You can
customize all the key bindings using the resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pop-up-menu">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">4.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pop-up menu</a></h3>
<p>Using the third mouse button in the text area brings a popup menu that contains
cursor-sensitive commands, as well as the common commands to navigate between
hunks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="searching">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">4.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching</a></h3>
<p>You can search the text by bringing up the search dialog.  Type your search
query and press enter, which will apply the search and display diamond shaped
match locations in the overview area. You can then navigate the search results
using Ctrl-F and Ctrl-B.  Searching will occur in all files simultaneously.  You
have to reapply the search to search for something else.</p>
<p>You can also move the cursor and display to a particular line from the search
dialog.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-options">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">4.1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other options</a></h3>
<p>Carriage returns (CR) characters in DOS files can be hidden in the text area.</p>
<p>Tabs by default are rendered aligned at each 8 characters, but can be set to any
value by changing the tab width option.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="display-options">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">4.1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display options</a></h3>
<p>The display options can be fully customized by bringing up the options dialog
with the &quot;Display -&gt; Display Options...&quot; menu item.  From that dialog you can
also customize the colors and fonts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="redoing-the-diffs">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redoing the diffs</a></h2>
<p>If a file has changed while xxdiff is up, and there is need to recompute the
diffs, invoke the &quot;redo diff&quot; command from the edit menu.  The arguments used
with the surrogate diff command can be changed by using the dialog provided by
the &quot;diff arguments&quot; command.  One can also replace a loaded file with a
different one by using the &quot;open&quot; commands from the &quot;file&quot; menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-ui-elements">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other UI elements</a></h2>
<p>The following other UI elements can be optionally hidden or displayed from the
Windows menu or Display menu (use the resource file to display or hide them on
startup):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Overview area.</strong> On the right side, an area that shows a color-coded
pictorial rendering of the diff hunks for the whole files, with
correspondances.  This area also shows the as a rectangle the currently
visible portion of text for each of the files.  This rectangle can also be
used as a scrollbar.  In addition, a marker indicates the location of the line
cursor.</li>
<li><strong>Remaining Unselected Hunks.</strong> Just above the overview area is a label that
indicates the number of remaining unselected diff hunks between the files.  In
addition, if that number is zero, and if the files are identical
byte-for-byte, it display a &quot;(=)&quot; string next to the number, so that you can
figure out quickly if the files have any ignored whitespace changes or not
(this can be important during merge review).</li>
<li><strong>Toolbar.</strong> A toolbar that gives access to the common motion and selection
commands.</li>
<li><strong>Filenames.</strong> For each file, a region at the top that displays the filename.
You can customize what shows up in this region from the command-line.
Clicking on the filename puts it in the clipboard for cut-n-paste.  (This
label will intelligently display the end part of the filename if it is too
long to fit.)  This region also display the text line that the line cursor is
in, for each file.  You can customize what gets displayed in this labeled by
using a command-line option.</li>
<li><strong>Line numbers.</strong> For each file, a thin window that display the number of each
line (dummy alignment lines don't have any number).</li>
<li><strong>Vertical line.</strong> A vertical line can be drawn in the text area, at a
specified column.  This can be used for alignment purposes or for verifying
that a line doesn't extend beyond a specified number of characters (many
people like to limit their source code to fit in e.g. 80 characters).</li>
<li><strong>Merged view</strong>. A view of the file resulting from the currently selected
regions (see section on <a class="reference internal" href="#merged-view">Merged view</a> below).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparing-two-files">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing two files</a></h1>
<p>When invoking xxdiff with two files, we normally think of an old and a new file,
where:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
xxdiff old new
</pre>
<p>The default colors used here are symmetrical, so invoking the files in a
different order will result in regions being assigned the same colors.</p>
<div class="section" id="types-of-hunks">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of hunks</a></h2>
<p>The following hunk types can appear when comparing two files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Same</strong>: no change in that region;</li>
<li><strong>Insert</strong>: text has been added to the new file;</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>: text has been deleted from the new file;</li>
<li><strong>Diff</strong>: text has changed between the files.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="merging-files-and-resolving-conflicts">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id32">8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merging files and resolving conflicts</a></h1>
<p>Merging files is the process of manually resolving conflicts when two files
cannot be merged automatically.  This is a common problem when doing parallel
software development where multiple developers could be working on the same
files.</p>
<p>Most of the merging can be handled automatically, because if the changes were
applied to fairly independent parts of the files, most of the changes will be
insertions or deletions.  However, when overlapping changes occur, no automatic
decision can be taken.</p>
<p>xxdiff can be used to resolve conflicts by letting the user &quot;select&quot; which side
of a diff hunk should be killed and what side should be kept.  The user can take
this decision on a line-by-line basis, and can decide to keep both sides as
well, in any order.  xxdiff then allows the user to save the resulting file.</p>
<div class="section" id="selecting-regions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id33">8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selecting regions</a></h2>
<p>Selecting a diff hunk can be carried out by clicking on it.  The colors update
to display which side is selected for output. You can select individual lines
with the second button.  There are three types of selection that you can carry
out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>select clicked file;</li>
<li>select no file (take the decision that nothing will be output);</li>
<li>leave the line/hunk unselected.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to select more than one side, you have to invoke the split-swap-join
command (default is on 'S' key), which will split the current diff hunk if it's
a Diff hunk so you can select the pieces you want from both sides.  Further
invocations of this command will cause swapping the regions, looping through all
the different ordering possibilities, and finally joining the regions again
(preserving selections where it is possible).</p>
<p>If you want to select individual lines, use the second button of the mouse on
the lines that you want to select.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving-the-resulting-file">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id34">8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving the resulting file</a></h2>
<p>The resulting file can be saved under one of the input filenames, under a
computed &quot;merged&quot; filename, or under a new filename (from the File menu). The
intended &quot;merged&quot; filename can be built from the input filenames and it's format
can be specified through the resources file or the command line.</p>
<p>If some regions are left unselected, the save
dialog will have some widgets that allows you to decide how you want to save the
unselected hunks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Save as merge conflicts:</strong> save all sides, separating them with merge
conflict markers similar to those inserted by CVS;</li>
<li><strong>Save with conditionals:</strong> save all sides, separating them with C
pre-processor directives, so that you could then use a #define directive to
have one set of changes or another be active if compiling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The markers and pre-processor directives can be customized through the resources
file.</p>
<p>There is a customization flag that lets you specify that xxdiff should warn you
when trying to save with some regions unselected.  It will bring the cursor to
the first remaining unselected region and ask for confirmation. This can be used
to insure that the user has made all the required decisions before saving and
that no text will be forgotten.</p>
<p>You could also decide to save only the selected regions, from the File menu.
This can be useful for making comments when reviewing merges.</p>
<div class="section" id="forcing-output-of-a-merged-file-and-better-script-integration">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id35">8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcing Output of a Merged File and Better Script Integration</a></h3>
<p>xxdiff is often used for merging conflicts, replacing some of the tools that are
provided with popular configuration management systems. Sometime it is
&quot;required&quot; that the conflict resolution tool output the merged file. To that
extent, xxdiff has a special mode triggered with the option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--decision</span></tt> to
address specifically that need. When specified, the exit functionality is
replaced with three functions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>exit with ACCEPT: the string &quot;ACCEPT&quot; is printed on stdout.  The left file is
automatically saved into the merged file;</li>
<li>exit with REJECT: the string &quot;REJECT&quot; is printed on stdout.  The right file is
automatically saved into the merged file;</li>
<li>exit with MERGED: the string &quot;MERGED&quot; is printed on stdout.  If there are
remaining conflictual hunks when exiting, a popup will ask how to deal with
them, you are forced to make a selection on all the hunks.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to allow for a fast process where the user is presented with a series of
xxdiffs and has to make decisions on each. The calling script can then do
whatever is required to integrate the resulting file into its workflow.</p>
<p>If the window is killed, the merge file is not saved and NODECISION is output
(the script that calls xxdiff must be prepared to deal with that somehow).
Also, note that you are responsible for deleting the merged file.  Also in this
mode, if the merged file already exists, it gets overwritten without warning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rapid-sequential-merge-conflict-resolution">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id36">8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid, sequential merge conflict resolution</a></h2>
<p>Some people like to merge files within a guided process, where the visual diff
program asks for a merge decision for each conflictual hunk one-by-one and then
asks for a filename to use for saving the merged output.  For example, that is
how ClearCase's xcleardiff works when querying the user to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>There are a set of commands under the Region menu that allows one to rapidly
take decisions on merge conflicts.  These commands perform a selection and then
automatically move the cursor to the next unselected region.  If there are no
more unselected regions, the save dialog is brought up automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automatic-merge">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id37">8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic merge</a></h2>
<p>By default, xxdiff doesn't perform any selections.  You can instruct xxdiff to
perform the initial selection of the non-conflictual regions automatically.
This can be specified from the command-line or from the Global menu.</p>
<p>Just like xxdiff can be instructed not to show up if there aren't any
differences between the files, xxdiff can also be instructed not to show up if
after the automatic merge there remains no conflictual regions. You can use the
return value to find out.</p>
<p>(Note that we do not want to add a feature to xxdiff to allow it to output to
the merged file if there are no conflics, because that would amount to make
xxdiff a non-graphical tool, while its mandate is to use such tools underneath
and display their output. Besides, that would be the single case where xxdiff
writes to a file without a file dialog.  You can very easily implement this from
within a script using the return value of either diff or xxdiff.)</p>
<div class="section" id="requiring-an-output-file">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id38">8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requiring an output file</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes we want to force the user into producing a merged output file (when
calling xxdiff from an update script, for example). Thus there is a feature to
put xxdiff in this mode (see resources or invocation section). In this mode, the
user must save before exiting xxdiff (exiting will prompt for save filename).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merging-directories">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id39">8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merging directories</a></h2>
<p>Selecting is disable in directory diffs mode, where the concept of &quot;saving&quot; a
directory does not really make sense.  However, you can apply changes to a
directory from xxdiff, such as copying and removing files under the line cursor.
This can be invoked from the popup menu in the text area.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merged-view">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id40">8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merged view</a></h2>
<p>During selection or before saving the selected regions into the result file, you
might want to visualize what it would look like with the current selections.
You can display the &quot;merged view&quot; for this purpose, an dedicated window
showing the merge output, that updates interactively as you make selections.</p>
<p>This view will scroll to match the main display.  Unselected regions are shown
in this view with oblique lines (&quot;in construction&quot; style), and merge decisions
are slightly highlighted as well.  This output allows you to review the merge
decisions before commiting the file to output.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merge-review-features">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id41">9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merge review features</a></h1>
<p>One of the most important uses of xxdiff is to assist the merge review process,
where one developer visualizes the file changes of another and approves or
rejects those changes, making comments along the way.</p>
<p>For this purpose, xxdiff puts selected text (i.e. when you click on a diff hunk)
in the clipboard text buffer when you select it.  Thus, the merge cop can select
a region, and paste the results in a neighboring editor window.</p>
<p>These snippets of code will typically be interspersed with comments.  xxdiff can
be format the line contents before they are copied to the clipboard, to make
them distinct from the merge comments.  This can be enabled using the &quot;format
clipboard text&quot; option.  The clipboard line format is a string that contains
format specifiers similar to printf for each line to be formatted prior to being
put on the clipboard.  The following specifiers are allowed:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">%N</tt></dt>
<dd>file line (0 is leftmost file)</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">%L</tt></dt>
<dd>line number</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">%F</tt></dt>
<dd>filename</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">%s</tt></dt>
<dd>line contents</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is also a &quot;clipboard header format&quot; resource for adding the filename at
the top of the copied text. This is useful for quickly pasting into a merge
comments file.</p>
<p>Also note that clicking on the filename labels will put the filenames in the
clipboard for similar cut-n-paste action.  This can be useful when reviewing
ClearCase revision files, which often have very long p-names.</p>
<div class="section" id="variable-text-selection">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id42">9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variable text selection</a></h2>
<p>You can press ALT and Button1 to select an arbitrary number of lines.  The
selected lines will be marked with a special border to show what gets put in the
clipboard. This is very useful when you don't want to quote an entire diff hunk,
or a section of text that straddles hunks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id43">9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Per-hunk ignore whitespace</a></h2>
<p>Many source code changes often just reindent or reorganize blocks of code, and
result in many isolated hunks with no relevant changes to look at (for languages
that don't use whitespace semantics anyway). For merge police duties, this can
lead to more work to review changes, and typically, programmers (and groups,
sometimes) will explicitly choose not to allow code beautification because of
that very reason (...and the directed anger of merge cops themselves). xxdiff
now has a new feature that alleviates this problem greatly: it will scan each
diff hunk for non-whitespace changes, and if the only changes are of whitespace,
it will mark the hunk with a special flag. The &quot;ignore per-hunk whitespace&quot;
feature will draw these hunks with a different color, by default, a color very
similar to the &quot;same&quot; hunks. The hunks are not ignored, however, as skipping
from hunk to hunk will still stop at these hunks, but they can be very quickly
ignored by the merge police. So go on ahead now, and reindent that code without
fear.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unmerging-merge-conflicts">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id44">10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmerging merge conflicts</a></h1>
<p>Unmerging merge conflicts is a special input mode of xxdiff where a single file
containing the result of an automatic merge of two files is split into two files
and displayed as such.</p>
<p>This may sound like a &quot;trava lengua&quot;, but unmerging merge conflicts can be a
very useful feature, if you like to let your source code management system
automatically perform merges and save the output without user intervention, such
as the way CVS is normally used. Typical use of the CVS update command will
merge the main branch changes into your local copy files. When there are
conflicts, your files are modified to contain both your changes and the main
branch changes in the regions that conflict. CVS inserts text markers such as
the following to indicate the conflictual regions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Some merged text.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MYFILE
I added this.
========
This line added in main branch.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 1.1
Some finetext.
</pre>
<p>Then, the user is notified of the conflictual files, and has to go inspect the
conflicts and resolve them by editing the file accordingly. The problem is that
it is often quite difficult (and unpleasant) to figure out exactly what happened
during the automated merge process, without the original files (note that CVS
does make a backup copy of your file before writing it over with the merged
output, see CVS manual for details).</p>
<p>To help in figuring out what happened during merge and in performing the
user-directed selections, xxdiff can be invoked in &quot;unmerge mode&quot; with the file
containing the merge conflicts. It parses the file and generates two files from
it, displaying them with differences. You can then perform selections as usual
to produce the final merged file.</p>
<p>Note that we think that this is not the best way of resolving conflicts, rather
just a useful feature for people who like to work this way. A better way to
merge would be to use your source code management system to fetch the common
ancestor revision, the latest/head of the main branch and to invoke xxdiff with
your file, the ancestor and the latest/head. You can also tell xxdiff to
initially perform all non-conflictual selections automatically.</p>
<div class="section" id="unmerging-merge-conflicts-with-three-files">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id45">10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmerging merge conflicts with three files</a></h2>
<p>diff3 can be used to produce a merged file in which all the three files' regions
are shown if there is a conflict. xxdiff can also parse these files and display
them as a three-way diff. You then have to invoke xxdiff with the 'unmerge3'
command-line argument to let it know you want the file split in three.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="editing-files">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id46">11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editing files</a></h1>
<p>There has been a conscious decision NOT to develop xxdiff into a fully-featured
editing program.  Sometimes it could be handy to be able to edit a few lines of
a difficult conflict.  However, that is a task best left to your own favorite
editing program.  Saving with merge conflicts will allow you to resolve those
few remaining conflicts by hand.</p>
<p>However, a few commands have been provided under the File menu to spawn an
editor on the input files.  You can then redo the diff after your input file has
changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customization-using-resource-file">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id47">12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customization using resource file</a></h1>
<p>Much of the state of xxdiff can be customized through a resource file (actually,
some of the features can only be changed through resource customization).
By default, xxdiff looks for the file <tt class="docutils literal">.xxdiffrc</tt> located in the user's
home directory (this file location can be overriden by setting the environment
variable XXDIFFRC), and reads that file for resource definition.</p>
<p>The format of the resource file is a fairly simple list of colon-separated
resource name/value pairs, one per line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
resourceName: &quot;value&quot;
</pre>
<p>Any text after &quot;#&quot; on a line is considered a comment and ignored.</p>
<p>Some resources may require string delimiters (double-quotes) around their value
specification, but not all (see below).</p>
<p>You can also specify additional resources on the command-line, which take
precendence over the resources specified in the resource file.  To get a
complete list of the available resources, use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--list-resources</span></tt>
command-line option (see Options section).</p>
<p>Trick: you can use different resources files by invoking xxdiff like this in
most shells:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
