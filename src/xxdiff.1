.TH XXDIFF 1
.SH NAME
xxdiff \- a graphical file comparator and merge tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
xxdiff [OPTIONS] <path> <path> [<path>]
.SH OVERVIEW
.LP
.I xxdiff
is a graphical file and directories comparison and merge tool. It can be used
for viewing the differences between two or three files, or two directories, and
can be used to produce a merged version. The texts of the two or three files are
presented side by side with their differences highlighted with colors for easy
identification.
.LP 
The paths supplied on the command line identify the files to be compared.  The
paths may be one of three things:  a regular file, a directory or a '-', in
which case the input for that path will be read from standard input.  If the
paths are all directories, a directory diff will be performed.  If at least one
path is a file or a '-', a file diff will be performed.  If there are directory
names along with file names, the basename of the file name will be appended to
the directory names to find the other files to compare with.  If there are
multiple file names specified and some directories names as well, xxdiff bails
out, since it doesn't know which basename to use for the missing one.
