Version Control Tools and Other Utilities
=========================================

This directory contains tools that can be used to link xxdiff with version
control systems.  Some of these are unfinished.  Use them to build your own
(they should be simple anyway) and I'd be happy to add your contributions in
here.

Important note:  cvs.py is working well, and being used in other
contexts, but I haven't had time to implement xxcvs and xxcleartool 
yet.

- `clearcase <clearcase>`_
- `cvs <cvs>`_
- `emacs <emacs>`_
- `misc <misc>`_
- `perforce <perforce>`_
- `subversion <subversion>`_
- `tla/arch <tla>`_
