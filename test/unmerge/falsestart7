Robert Love has been merged by Linus
Torvalds into the main linux
development-kernel tree, beginning
version v2.5.4-pre6. This adds a far
greater degree of real-time
responsiveness to the standard Linux
kernel, by reducing interrupt latencies
while kernel functions are
executing. The story at LinuxDevices.com
includes comments by Robert Love, and
there is also a recent interview with
Robert Love about the preemptable kernel
here and a whitepaper about the
technology by MontaVista here."
