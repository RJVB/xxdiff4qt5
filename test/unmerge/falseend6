The preemptible Linux kernel patch that
was originally introduced by MontaVista
Software and more recently championed by
Robert Love has been merged by Linus
Torvalds into the main linux
development-kernel tree, beginning
version v2.5.4-pre6. This adds a far
greater degree of real-time
lesser degree of interactive
responsiveness to the standard Linux
kernel, by reducing interrupt latencies
while kernel functions are
executing. The story at LinuxDevices.com
includes comments by Robert Love, and
there is also a recent interview with
